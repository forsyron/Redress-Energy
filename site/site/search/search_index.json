The REDRESS technology has huge potential both for Australia and other sunny parts of the world to transition to renewable energy at the lowest cost possible. The REDRESS technology is based on the established concentrated solar thermal (CST) approach to generating and storing renewable energy. Steam-based CST generation and thermal storage technology is already substantially cheaper than solar cells and batteries, but the energy from steam based CST is still around 12c/kWh to 18c/kWh - about 50% more expensive than energy generated using fossil fuels. The new REDRESS technology will substantially reduce that price gap, with the ultimate aim being to generate and store renewable energy for about the same cost as generating dirty energy using natural gas in gas turbines. REDRESS is taking a radical and unique approach to achieve that goal. The REDRESS approach is unique in several ways It is unique in that it uses a new and efficient rotary hot-air engine to convert the stored solar thermal energy into electricity. The new engine converts more of the concentrated solar energy into electrical energy than does the conventional steam turbine. The new engine will therefore increase the solar-to-electricity conversion factor, resulting in a significantly lower cost per kWh of the clean energy it produces. It is unique in that the power output of the new engine is much smaller than it would be with a steam turbine. The smaller power output of the engine means that the engine is suitable for use in generators small enough to be installed at a customer's premises. The result is that customers will soon be able to both generate and store their own clean energy at much lower cost than using solar cells and batteries. It is unique in that the REDRESS approach will enable manufacturers to fully assemble the modular generators in a factory from where they will be easily delivered to site. It is unique in that the only on-site work required to commission the generator will be the preparation of a flat piece of ground onto which to locate the generator housing, the installation of the solar collectors on top of the generator housing, and minor electrical works to commission the generator. It is unique in that the generator is designed to (ultimately) be mass-manufactured in fully automated factories so as to reduce the future cost of generating and storing renewable energy to the absolute minimum. The new REDRESS micro-generator technology is a radical departure from all current options for generating and storing renewable energy. It is suitable for installation at small business/industrial premises where it will generate and store renewable energy at a lower cost than energy purchased from the network. It is equally suitable for large business/industrial installations where multiple generators will combine to provide a genuine and economical renewable energy solution for Australia\u2019s energy needs into the future. Ultimately the REDRESS technology is expected to generate renewable energy 24/7 at a cost comparable to the current cost of wholesale electricity in the National Energy Market.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"The new REDRESS technology is the breakthrough Australia needs to transition to 100% affordable renewable energy without the need for expensive battery storage.

Convenient size The relatively small size of the Redress \u2018container generator\u2019 is a significant advantage. One of the most significant and unrecognized reasons CST generation has not been widely adopted is the large size of the typical CST generator. A typical traditional CST generator is between 1MW to 250MW in size, with most at the larger end of that range. But even a 1MW generator is ten to fifty times too large to be installed at the premises of most customers. So until now, CST generation and storage has mostly been ignored for small installations simply because the available generators were much too large for the customer\u2019s needs. The REDRESS approach overcomes that problem. The power output of the new hot air engine is much smaller than the power output of the steam turbines used in conventional CST installations. The smaller power output therefore allows this new technology to be used in applications for which traditional CST steam generators are entirely unsuited because of their significantly larger size. The size of a generator is particularly relevant as to whether it is a viable generator. In the National Electricity Market, a generator needs to be able to generate clean energy somewhere in the range of 5c/kWh to 10c/kWh to be competitive in the market and to be able to bid into the market for any significant period of time. A large CST generator needing to receive an average return of 15c/kWh for the energy it produces is therefore not likely to be a viable generator if it has to bid into the market to earn its revenue. However, a small CST generator that can generate and store energy at the same price of 15c/kWh can actually be a viable clean energy option if it is small enough to be located at a customer\u2019s premises because the customer would otherwise have to pay much higher prices for energy bought from the network. Having smaller CST generators, even at an energy cost of 15c/kWh, therefore makes CST generation much more viable because it allows CST generation to be installed at many more private installations. That will be a particularly significant advantage to many customers where energy costs are significantly higher than in the NEM (due to the network charges applied). To be commercially viable at a customer\u2019s premises, a generator only has to be cheaper than the lowest cost a retailer can offer supply - usually about 20c/kWh or higher in Australia. A small generator that can generate and store clean energy for less than 20c/kWh and can be installed at a customer\u2019s premises is therefore still a viable clean energy option at locations where a larger generator generating and storing energy even at say 15c/kWh is not a viable clean energy option. There is considerable potential for small generators to be installed at customers\u2019 premises in Australia and many other sunny parts of the world because such generators will make it possible to generate and store renewable energy at a lower cost than buying energy from the network. That advantage can only serve to significantly increase the demand for such generators and speed up the transition to clean energy around the world. While still too large for use at most single domestic dwellings, REDRESS generators will nevertheless have the potential to be used at commercial premises, within micro-grids, or at remote locations such as mines. There will also be significant opportunity for the generators to be used to bring electricity to remote areas in Africa and Asia that currently have no electricity whatsoever. Other Advantages The small size of the generator delivers several further benefits over those described above. These additional benefits allow for other novel cost-saving design features to be included that are not possible in large CST installations. Cheaper Manufacture and Installation The conventional approach to the construction of CST generators is relatively inefficient. The size of the installation means that the generator is to a large extent constructed on site from hundreds, perhaps thousands of components. Once on site, a great deal of manual labour is required to locate and assemble those pieces, which adds considerably to the cost of the project. The small size of REDRESS concept will transform the whole method of manufacturing and installing CST generators. Instead of transporting hundreds or perhaps thousands of individual components to site and assembling them manually, the modular REDRESS approach will be to manufacture and assemble complete generators in a factory so as to reduce manufacturing costs to a minimum. The REDRESS generators will therefore be as fully assembled as is possible before leaving the factory to minimize manufacturing costs, \u200b The REDRESS modular \u2018container generator\u2019 has also been designed so that it fits inside two standard shipping containers. The first shipping container accommodates the fully assembled generator except for the solar collectors, and obviously the solar collectors are delivered in the second container. Using just two trucks (or a single truck and a trailer), both shipping containers are delivered to site where the first shipping container is unloaded and becomes the generator housing. The solar collectors are then removed from the second shipping container, assembled and mounted on the generator housing. The design feature that each generator will be delivered in just two containers also reduces the delivery and installation costs to the minimum possible. The REDRESS design philosophy is for the generators to ultimately be mass-manufactured using fully automated production techniques. This will ensure that the manufacturing costs will be reduced to the lowest level possible. This approach also minimizes the expensive manual labour required on site. On-site construction times are substantially reduced because each generator can be installed in as little as 1-2 days once on site. Planning and design costs are also substantially reduced because instead of taking months or years to design an installation, the only design decision required with REDRESS generators is how many to order. Cheaper and Better Solar Collection The smaller size of the REDRESS \u2018container generator\u2019 also permits the use of a novel solar collector arrangement. This unique collector arrangement is designed to reduce manufacturing costs as well as to collect more energy per m\u00b2 of collector area compared with most CST arrangements. The new REDRESS solar collector arrangement will be a dual segmented parabolic mirror arrangement, semi-enclosed in a weather-resistant enclosure. The collectors will then be mounted on the roof of the generator housing instead of on the ground to reduce installation costs. The parabolic design enables maximum collection temperatures to be generated to reduce storage costs. The segmented reflectors will enable the use of thinner reflector glass to reduce both weight and costs. When the sun is shining, the collectors will move horizontally and vertically to track the sun. The collectors will therefore at all times collect the maximum amount of solar energy possible at the maximum temperature possible, particularly in winter. At night, shutters will come down to enclose the collectors to reduce contamination from dirt and night-time moisture which tends to make the dirt stick to the reflectors. It is also anticipated that automated washing of the solar collectors will also be offered in due course.","title":"Advantages"},{"location":"advantages/#advantages","text":"Apart from generating and storing clean energy at a lower cost than other options, the REDRESS 'Container Generator' concept has many other advantages. 1. 2. 3. 4.","title":"Advantages"},{"location":"advantages/#convenient-size","text":"The relatively small size of the Redress \u2018container generator\u2019 is a significant advantage.

CST generation is the original clean energy technology developed by Augustin Mouchot in 1866. Traditionally it uses cheap thermal storage to store concentrated solar energy as heat which is then used to drive a steam engine. Cheaper energy storage is becoming ever more important to the transition to clean energy. This old technology is therefore once again being focused upon because it offers energy storage at much lower cost than battery storage. Conventional CST generation is essentially the same technology used in coal fired generation except that the heat source is concentrated solar energy instead of coal. If CST generation wasn't so much more expensive than coal fired generation due to the use of more expensive solar energy and storage, then a traditional CST generator would be an ideal solution to Australia\u2019s clean energy needs. REDRESS believes that when compared with solar cells and batteries, conventional CST generation and storage still has many advantages: it is cheaper than solar cells and batteries by about 50% once larger amounts of storage are required CST generators can also be powered using supplementary renewable fuels such as biomass, biogas, etc, allowing CST generators to be used as base-load generators if required when solar energy reserves are depleted, and the waste heat from the generators can potentially used to manufacture further bio-fuels The only real problem with traditional CST generation is that cost of energy from traditional CST generators is still considerably higher than the cost of energy from coal or gas generators, and that the higher relative cost of energy is the principal reason CST generators are not widely used in Australia. The primary aim of the REDRESS technology therefore is to retain the technical advantages of CST generation and storage whilst also reducing the cost of energy produced to as close as possible to the current cost of energy from coal and gas generators. The method by which the cost of energy generated and stored using CST technology is to be reduced is by replacing the steam turbine technology used in most CST installations with a new and much more efficient hot air engine. It is also a secondary aim to reduce the size of CST generators so they can be installed at customer\u2019s premises. This will allow some customers to generate and store their own clean energy at a significantly lower cost than they can purchase energy from the network. REDRESS believes that only by achieving those two targets can renewable energy become truly affordable and available to all Australians and millions of people living in other sunny parts of the world.","title":"Background"},{"location":"background/#background","text":"The REDRESS technology is based on the established concentrated solar thermal (CST) approach to generating and storing renewable energy.

Unfortunately, while battery costs are still coming down, the rate at which prices are coming down is much too slow to encourage a rapid transition to mass storage of energy. Like most countries of the world, Australia is facing a storage crisis in its transition to clean energy. One of the great advantages of solar powered energy in Australia is that almost everywhere receives copious amounts of bright sunlight. That is why Australia has the one of the highest rates of solar cell usage in the world. But along with that rapid adoption of solar powered clean energy is the ever increasing problem of solar cells having to be turned off sometimes so as to prevent excessive energy making the supply system unstable. If battery storage was really affordable, that problem would not exist because the excess energy available at those times would be stored for later use. What Australia needs is more affordable storage, and quickly. So, is thermal storage a possible solution? The short answer is that thermal storage is very much a solution. We know that thermal storage works and is much cheaper than battery storage. Better still, the new REDRESS technology will reduce the cost of thermal storage even further. To demonstrate why thermal storage is so much cheaper than battery storage, following is a cost analysis explaining why thermal storage is a better option than batteries. (Please note: the following comparison is in US Dollars rather than Australian Dollars because energy storage costs are usually expressed in US Dollars/kWh to allow various approaches to be compared). Why Thermal Storage is Cheaper than Battery Storage in Australia: Thermal storage is a better option than battery storage in most places in Australia because storing solar energy as heat is relatively cheap. There are several thermal storage options available at a cost of about US$25/kWh or less. In comparison, the cost of battery storage using lithium-ion batteries ranges from about US$280/kWh for large utility scale batteries up to about US$800/kWh for smaller domestic/household scale batteries. That means it is somewhere between 12 and 30 times more expensive to store electrical energy in batteries than to store solar energy as heat. However, to compare the cost of storing solar energy as heat for the purpose of generating clean energy against the cost of storing clean energy from a solar cell in batteries, we also need to factor in the efficiency of the engine used to convert the heat into electricity. For steam based CST generators, the efficiency of the turbine is usually in the range of 15% to 18%. That means it takes between 6.67 to 5.56 or roughly about 6 times more heat energy to produce each unit of clean electricity using a steam turbine. (For simplicity, the next part of the explanation will assume that it takes exactly 6 units of solar thermal energy to generate one unit of clean electricity.) Combining the turbine efficiency with the cost of storing heat, the cost of storing heat to generate each unit of clean electricity can now be calculated to be 6xUS$25/kWh = US$150/kWh approximately. With battery storage costs somewhere in the range of US$280/kWh \u2013 US$800/kWh according to the size of the battery, the current cost of storing clean energy in batteries is therefore approximately 2 to 5 times more expensive than using thermal storage. However, with the new engine proposed in the REDRESS technology, that disparity between the cost of battery storage and thermal storage increases even further. As mentioned previously, the REDRESS engine will be at least 50% more efficient than the steam turbine it replaces for the same heat input. With the improved efficiency of the REDRESS technology, the cost/kWh of thermal storage is now anticipated to drop from around US$150/kWh to US$100/kWh or lower. The cost of battery storage will then in the range of 3 to 7.5 times more expensive than thermal storage using the REDRESS technology. It is clear that not only is thermal storage already significantly cheaper than battery storage, but it also has the potential to be cheaper still if the heat-to-energy conversion factor is improved by using a more efficient engine. With the now urgent need for large amounts of clean energy storage to facilitate the transfer to a clean energy future, the answer for Australia clearly has to be the use of thermal storage in one form or another instead of the substantially more expensive battery storage.","title":"Storage"},{"location":"storage/#storage","text":"Affordable storage is the key to facilitating a rapid and successful transition to clean energy. Unfortunately, while battery costs are still coming down, the rate at which prices are coming down is much too slow to encourage a rapid transition to mass storage of energy. Like most countries of the world, Australia is facing a storage crisis in its transition to clean energy. One of the great advantages of solar powered energy in Australia is that almost everywhere receives copious amounts of bright sunlight. That is why Australia has the one of the highest rates of solar cell usage in the world. But along with that rapid adoption of solar powered clean energy is the ever increasing problem of solar cells having to be turned off sometimes so as to prevent excessive energy making the supply system unstable.
