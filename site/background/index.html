<p>The REDRESS technology is based on the established concentrated solar thermal (CST) approach to generating and storing renewable energy. CST generation is the original clean energy technology developed by Augustin Mouchot in 1866. Traditionally it uses cheap thermal storage to store concentrated solar energy as heat which is then used to drive a steam engine. Cheaper energy storage is becoming ever more important to the transition to clean energy. This old technology is therefore once again being focused upon because it offers energy storage at much lower cost than battery storage.</p>
<p>Conventional CST generation is essentially the same technology used in coal fired generation except that the heat source is concentrated solar energy instead of coal. If CST generation wasn't so much more expensive than coal fired generation due to the use of more expensive solar energy and storage, then a traditional CST generator would be an ideal solution to Australia’s clean energy needs.</p>
<p>REDRESS believes that when compared with solar cells and batteries, conventional CST generation and storage still has many advantages:</p>
<p>it is cheaper than solar cells and batteries by about 50% once larger amounts of storage are required</p>
<p>CST generators can also be powered using supplementary renewable fuels such as biomass, biogas, etc, allowing CST generators to be used as base-load generators if required when solar energy reserves are depleted, and</p>
<p>the waste heat from the generators can potentially used to manufacture further bio-fuels</p>
<p>The only real problem with traditional CST generation is that cost of energy from traditional CST generators is still considerably higher than the cost of energy from coal or gas generators, and that the higher relative cost of energy is the principal reason CST generators are not widely used in Australia.</p>
<p>The primary aim of the REDRESS technology therefore is to retain the technical advantages of CST generation and storage whilst also reducing the cost of energy produced to as close as possible to the current cost of energy from coal and gas generators. The method by which the cost of energy generated and stored using CST technology is to be reduced is by replacing the steam turbine technology used in most CST installations with a new and much more efficient hot air engine.</p>
<p>It is also a secondary aim to reduce the size of CST generators so they can be installed at customer’s premises. This will allow some customers to generate and store their own clean energy at a significantly lower cost than they can purchase energy from the network.</p>
<p>REDRESS believes that only by achieving those two targets can renewable energy become truly affordable and available to all Australians and millions of people living in other sunny parts of the world.</p>
