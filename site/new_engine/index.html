<p>The core technology of the new REDRESS approach to storing and generating cheaper clean energy is to use of a new and efficient rotary hot-air engine instead of the more conventional steam turbine. So what is a hot-air engine?</p>
<p>The term ‘hot-air engine’ was used to refer to a type of engine developed in the early to late 19th century. However, these engines, usually powered by coal, used heated air as the operating medium instead of steam – hence the term hot air engines. There are two basic types of hot-air engines and both types were used successfully during the 19th century. Ultimately both these engines were developed into the modern-day internal combustion engines that we use today. In today’s terms, hot-air engines are modern engines redesigned so that the combustion part is moved from inside the engine back to the outside of the engine.</p>
<p>The Redress hot-air engine is an updated version of an engine once described as having insurmountable problems. However, with suitable development and with the use of modern day materials, Redress believes this engine now has the potential to become the almost-ideal engine to convert solar thermal energy into renewable energy. Once fully developed, the new REDRESS engine will convert 50%-100% more of the collected solar energy into electrical energy than its steam turbine counterpart. The new engine will therefore increase the solar-to-electrical conversion factor, and significantly lower the cost per kWh of the clean energy it produces.</p>
<p>By replacing the steam turbine with a more efficient hot air engine, the rate at which solar thermal energy is converted into electrical energy will increase from about 15%-18% up to about 25% - 30%, or perhaps even higher. The new engine will result in the energy cost per kWh potentially decreasing by somewhere between 28% and 50% subject to engine cost.</p>
<p>The new engine will transform CST generation.</p>
